# Titan Agent

## Overview
Titan Agent is an open-source software suite that serves as the foundation of the Titan Network ecosystem. It enables providers to contribute their idle computing resources by simply installing the agent on their unused devices.

Acting as a resource orchestration layer, Titan Agent implements multi-tenancy through virtualization technologies (VMs and containers), dynamically provisioning isolated environments based on client requirements. This approach ensures both security for providers and consistent access for customers, regardless of the underlying hardware.

Representing the core of our current architectural direction in the Fourth testnet implementation, Titan Agent standardizes diverse computing resources according to the Titan Protocol, allowing them to be efficiently managed and utilized within the Titan ecosystem.

## Core Functions

### 1. Support for Multiple Device Types
To accommodate a wide range of idle resources in the Titan ecosystem, Titan Agent is designed to support various device types:
- Desktop computers: Windows, Linux, and MacOS
- Mobile devices: Android phones and tablets
- Server equipment in data centers

This broad compatibility enables different types of idle resources to join the Titan Network after standardization through Titan Agent.

### 2. Resource Standardization
Standardization of idle resources serves several important purposes:

- **Protocol Compliance**: As an open and open-source ecosystem, Titan requires all resources to adhere to a standard protocol (Titan Protocol) to be properly managed within the network.

- **Abstraction of Resource Diversity**: By standardizing resources, we hide the underlying differences between various device types, providing customers with a smooth and consistent interface for utilizing idle resources.

- **Resource Security**: Resource providers are concerned not only with the economic benefits from the Titan ecosystem but also with the security of their devices. The standardization process ensures resource isolation and independence from the host machine, as required by the Titan Protocol.

### 3. Standardization Technologies
Titan Agent employs different standardization technologies based on the type and characteristics of the idle resources:

- For Windows PCs: Virtual machine (VM) technology
- For mobile devices: JS/WASM container technology
- For Linux PCs and servers: Kubernetes (K8S) container technology
