# Titan Agent

## Overview
Titan Agent is an open-source software suite that serves as the foundation of the Titan Network ecosystem. It enables providers to contribute their idle computing resources by simply installing the agent on their unused devices.

As a resource orchestration layer, Titan Agent implements multi-tenancy through virtualization technologies (VMs and containers), dynamically provisioning isolated environments based on client requirements. This approach ensures both security for providers and consistent access for customers, regardless of the underlying hardware.

Representing the core of our current architectural direction in the Fourth testnet implementation, Titan Agent standardizes various resources (computing, storage, bandwidth, IP) according to the Titan Protocol, allowing them to be efficiently managed and utilized within the Titan ecosystem.

## Core Functions

### 1. Support for Multiple Device Types
To accommodate a wide range of idle resources in the Titan ecosystem, Titan Agent is designed to support various device types:

- Desktop computers: Windows, Linux, and MacOS
- Mobile devices: Android phones and tablets
- Server equipment in data centers
- Embedded devices: Raspberry Pi, ARM development boards, NAS, etc.

### 2. Resource Standardization
Standardization of idle resources serves several important purposes:

- **Protocol Compliance:** As an open and open-source ecosystem, Titan requires all resources to adhere to a standard protocol (Titan Protocol) to be properly managed within the network.

- **Abstraction of Resource Diversity:** By standardizing resources, we hide the underlying differences between various device types, providing customers with a smooth and consistent interface for utilizing idle resources.

- **Resource Security:** Resource providers are concerned not only with the economic benefits from the Titan ecosystem but also with the security of their devices. The standardization process ensures resource isolation and independence from the host machine, as required by the Titan Protocol.

### 3. Standardization Technologies
Titan Agent employs different standardization technologies based on the type and characteristics of the idle resources:

#### 3.1 Desktop Platforms

| Platform | Virtualization Technology Priority |
|----------|-----------------------------------|
| Windows | 1. Hyper-V (Native)<br>2. VMware<br>3. VirtualBox<br>4. Docker (WSL2)<br>5. QEMU (Cross-architecture emulation) |
| macOS | 1. Docker Desktop<br>2. Parallels<br>3. UTM (QEMU GUI)<br>4. QEMU (Cross-architecture emulation) |

## Workflow

1. The client runs Titan Agent
2. Titan Agent selects the appropriate isolation environment (VM/container/Termux/WASM) based on the device's resource configuration. All connected heterogeneous resources are uniformly processed
3. Within the isolation environment, Titan Agent distributes service programs and resource usage quotas
4. After the program runs, it is billed and paid according to actual resource usage

## Advantages

- **Security Isolation:** Customer programs are strictly isolated from user devices through VM and container technologies, avoiding security risks
- **Environment Compatibility:** Through virtualization technologies, customer programs don't need to adapt to specific requirements; almost any program can run successfully
- **Program Transparency:** Whether open-source or not, programs that are completely black-box to resource providers can be executed
- **Resource Utilization Efficiency:** The most suitable virtualization technology is selected based on device characteristics, ensuring efficient resource utilization
- **Win-Win Situation:** Resource providers gain security assurance with no impact on their devices; customers get a flexible runtime environment capable of running almost any program
